# SOFTENG 306 Project 1 Team 3
SOLID principles make up the foundation of object-oriented programming. By asserting a set of guidelines for developers, SOLID principles ensure that software systems are built in such a way that they are easier to maintain and extend in the long run. For this project, our team is tasked with creating a shopping mobile application. The application will be built for the Android operating system and the technology stack to be used includes Java, XML, and Firebase.

Our team decided to make the shopping application dedicated towards selling exclusive art. Due to the high price and rarity of the listed items, the application is dedicated towards extremely wealthy consumers. This application will allow its users to browse through different categories, sort and apply filters, view individual items and their details, add items to their favourites, and more.

This report will explore the detailed analysis carried out during the planning stage of this application. This includes system modelling, system design, graphical user interface design, along with design analysis taking into account vital aspects such as SOLID principles and code smells.
